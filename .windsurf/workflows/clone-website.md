# Clone Website

Reverse-engineer and rebuild **the target URL (plus any extra instructions) provided by the user** as a pixel-accurate, multi-page Next.js clone.

You are a **foreman walking the job site**: scripts do the measuring, you do the judgment, specs are the contract, builder agents do the construction, and the pixel-diff score decides when you're done. Extraction and construction overlap — dispatch builders as soon as a section's spec passes lint, then keep extracting.

## Resume Check (ALWAYS FIRST)

```bash
node scripts/manifest.mjs resume
```

If a manifest exists, this is a **resumed run**: the digest shows every section's stage AND the exact next commands with real file paths — run them instead of re-deriving where you were. If not, this is a fresh run — start at Phase 0. (`status` prints just the table, `next` the single next section.)

## Scope Defaults

- **Fidelity:** pixel-accurate — colors, spacing, typography, animations, interactions
- **In scope:** every confirmed page, visual layout, component structure, interactions, responsive behavior (phone 390 / iPad 768 / PC 1440), real content and assets
- **Out of scope:** real backend, auth, databases, forms that actually submit (mock them)
- **Content goes in `src/data/*.ts`** — components take props; page files wire data to components. This keeps the clone restylable later (see `/restyle`).

User-provided instructions override these defaults.

## Tooling

The scripts do the mechanical work — **use them instead of hand-measuring via browser MCP**:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **`node scripts/extract/page.mjs <url> [--no-site-files]`** | **THE WORKHORSE — one call, 3 page loads total.** Auto-detects sections, then produces `tokens.json` + `css.json` (skip on later pages with `--no-site-files`), `assets.json` + downloads to `public/`, `responsive.json` (all 3 viewports), a full computed-style walk per section (`sections/<name>.json`), and full-page **and** per-section screenshots at phone/iPad/PC. Accepts explicit `--selector "css" --name x` pairs to override detection. Everything is measured from the SAME page state, so numbers, walks and screenshots can never disagree |
| `node scripts/extract/crawl.mjs <url> [--max 25]` | Discover pages (sitemap + nav links) → `docs/research/<host>/sitemap.json` |
| `node scripts/extract/section.mjs <url> --selector "css" [--name x] --state scroll:600\|click:sel\|hover:sel [--viewport pc\|ipad\|phone]` | **State captures** (page.mjs covers the default state). Captures a second state and diffs them (element styles *and* `::before`/`::after`), waiting for the section's real transition duration. `--selector`/`--name` repeat — one page load for all |
| `node scripts/extract/probe.mjs <url> --selector "css" [--selector "css2"] [--props a,b,c]` / `probe.mjs --route </r>` | Exact computed values for specific selectors at all 3 viewports, as a markdown table with a **varies** column — paste straight into a spec's Responsive section. **`--route` probes EVERY registered section of a page in one call (3 loads total, plus a `probe-<section>.json` per section) — never probe section-by-section** |
| `node scripts/extract/screenshot.mjs <url> [--selector css --name x ...]` | Extra screenshots at phone/iPad/PC (page.mjs already shot everything once). `--selector`/`--name` repeat — one call, 3 loads, N sections |
| `node scripts/extract/tokens.mjs` / `css.mjs` / `assets.mjs` / `responsive.mjs` | Single-purpose re-runs of one page.mjs output when something needs refreshing |
| `node scripts/resolve-walk.mjs <sections-json> [--node <path>]` | Reader for section-walk JSON (compact or legacy): indexed outline of the tree, and fully resolved computed styles for any one node. Use this instead of reading the raw JSON — walks are stored compact (style dictionary + inherited-prop pruning) |
| `node scripts/diff.mjs --original <url> --clone <url> [--selector css] --viewport all [--threshold 95]` | Scored pixel diff, original vs clone. **`--viewport all` scores pc+ipad+phone in one call**, and the per-viewport **band breakdown names the y-range where the mismatch lives** — read it before guessing at causes. **QA sweeps use `--route </r> --triage`: whole-page diff first, per-section diffs only for sections overlapping failing bands.** Plain `--route` (or repeated `--section name=css`) scores every section from ONE load per side per viewport. Original-side shots are cached 24h, so fix-iteration re-diffs only re-render the clone (`--fresh-original` to override) |
| **`node scripts/spec-scaffold.mjs --route <r> --section <name>`** (or `--all`) | **Generates the mechanical spec sections** (frontmatter, DOM, computed styles, assets, text, responsive) straight from the extraction JSON into `docs/research/components/<route-slug>/<name>.spec.md`, leaving `<!-- AGENT: fill -->` blocks for the judgment parts. Never transcribe JSON values by hand |
| `node scripts/compare.mjs --original <url> --clone <url> --selector "css" [--viewport vp]` | **Property-level diff for failing QA sections** — walks both live DOMs, aligns them structurally, prints differing computed properties ordered by visual impact (geometry > typography > color) plus missing/extra nodes. Run on a failing band BEFORE editing anything |
| `node scripts/lint-spec.mjs <spec.md\|dir>` | Mechanical spec-completeness gate — must pass before ANY builder dispatch |
| `node scripts/manifest.mjs <cmd>` | Pipeline state: init / add-page / add-section / set / status / next / **resume** (one-screen digest: stage table + exact next commands and file paths) |

**Screenshots come in two sizes.** Every screenshot the scripts produce gets a 640px-wide `-review.png` twin (when the full-res is wider). **Open the `-review.png` for judgment work** — reviewing sections, comparing pages, inspecting failing diff bands; it's visually sufficient at half the cost. Full-res files are for pixelmatch and for builder-agent prompts only.

Browser MCP (Chrome MCP, Playwright MCP — if available) is for **judgment work only**: watching how the page behaves while scrolling, exploring what's clickable, understanding an animation. Numbers always come from the scripts. If no browser MCP is available, the scripts alone are sufficient — use extra `screenshot.mjs` and `section.mjs --state` calls to observe behavior.

The scripts are plain Node CLIs — any coding agent can run them. Playwright's Chromium auto-installs on the first script run (or run `npm run setup` once). If your tool has no subagent/worktree support, skip the dispatch mechanics and build each section yourself, sequentially, from the same lint-passing specs — every quality gate still applies.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Completeness beats speed.** A builder that has to guess a color, font size, or padding value means extraction failed. Extract one more property rather than ship an incomplete spec.
2. **Small tasks, perfect results.** One focused component per builder. Spec body over 150 lines = split the section (lint-spec enforces this).
3. **Real content, real assets.** Actual text via the section walker, actual files via `assets.mjs`. Watch for **layered images** — a hero that looks like one image is often background + overlay + foreground; `assets.json` records sibling counts and z-index for exactly this reason.
4. **Foundation first.** Tokens, fonts, types, icons, and shared chrome (header/footer) before any page section.
5. **Extract how it looks AND how it behaves.** Every interactive element needs before/after states with exact values — `section.mjs --state` produces the diff mechanically.
6. **Identify the interaction model before building.** Scroll-driven vs click-driven confusion is the most expensive mistake in cloning — a wrong call means a rewrite, not a CSS fix. Scroll first without clicking and watch; only then click. Record the model in the spec frontmatter.
7. **Responsive is measured, never guessed — at all three widths.** Fill every spec's Responsive section from `responsive.json` + `probe.mjs`, with real numbers for phone AND iPad AND pc. Never write "iPad: same as desktop": most production sites step their root font-size at breakpoints, so *every* padding, margin, and font size changes even when the layout looks identical. A spec that only nails desktop produces a clone that scores ~98% at 1440px and ~91% at 390px. `lint-spec.mjs` rejects vague responsive sections.

8. **The extraction JSON is ground truth; the spec is a summary of it.** If a builder finds the spec disagreeing with `sections/<name>.json` or `responsive.json`, the JSON wins — say so explicitly in every builder prompt and have the builder report the discrepancy so you can correct the spec.
9. **Spec files are the contract.** No spec → no builder. lint-spec must pass → then dispatch.
10. **The build must always compile.** Builders verify `npx tsc --noEmit`; you verify `npm run typecheck && npm run lint` after every merge. Full `npm run build` runs only at checkpoints (Phase 0, end of Phase 2, once mid-way through Phase 3, Phase 4, completion) — it takes 30–60s and running it per merge serializes otherwise-parallel builders.
11. **The manifest tracks every stage transition.** The scripts self-report the transitions they own — page.mjs marks `extracted` (and registers new sections), lint-spec marks `specd` on pass, diff.mjs `--route` sweeps record scores and `qa_passed`. You update only the stages no script can see: `built` and `merged` (via `manifest.mjs set`), which also remains the manual override for anything else.

## Phase 0 — Crawl & Scope

1. Verify the base builds: `npm run build`.
2. `node scripts/extract/crawl.mjs <url> --max 25`
3. Show the user the discovered pages (route + source). **Ask which to clone** — recommend: start page + nav pages, skip legal/utility pages unless asked. Default cap ~10.
4. Initialize state:
   ```bash
   node scripts/manifest.mjs init <url>
   node scripts/manifest.mjs add-page --url <url> --route /        # per confirmed page
   ```

## Phase 1 — Recon (one page.mjs call per page)

1. **First page:** `node scripts/extract/page.mjs <start-url>` — produces tokens, css, assets+downloads, responsive signatures, per-section walks, and every screenshot in one shot (3 page loads).
2. **Every other confirmed page:** `node scripts/extract/page.mjs <url> --no-site-files` (tokens/css are site-wide; everything else is per-page). Downloads dedupe across pages automatically — files already in `public/` are skipped.
3. **Review the detected sections** in each run's stdout summary (name, selector, pc height, headline responsive change). Detection is a heuristic: if a "section" is really two, or two are really one, re-run with explicit `--selector "css" --name x` pairs. Section names become spec/component names — when detection got the sections RIGHT but the names wrong (`section-3` fallbacks), **don't re-extract**: `node scripts/extract/page.mjs --rename section-3=hero,section-4=features` renames the JSONs, probe files, screenshots, responsive.json and manifest entries in place with zero page loads.
4. **Interaction sweep** (judgment work — browser MCP if available): scroll each page slowly top to bottom. Does the header change? Do elements animate in? Auto-switching tabs? Scroll-snap? Smooth-scroll lib (`tokens.json` flags `.lenis`/Locomotive)? Then click every tab/pill/accordion and note what changes. Then hover. `css.json`'s `interactiveStates` lists every :hover/:focus rule the stylesheet defines — use it as the checklist of what to probe. Record findings in `docs/research/<host>/BEHAVIORS.md`.
5. **Shared chrome detection:** compare screenshots across pages — header/nav/footer that repeat become SHARED components (`SiteHeader`, `SiteFooter`), extracted once from the page where they're most complete.

**Per page — topology:** map every distinct section top to bottom with a working name, its selector, its interaction model (static / click-driven / scroll-driven / hover-driven / time-driven / mixed), and layer notes (sticky? overlay? z-index?). Save `docs/research/<host>/PAGE_TOPOLOGY.md`, then register each section:
```bash
node scripts/manifest.mjs add-section --route / --name hero --selector "section.hero"
```

## Phase 2 — Foundation (sequential, you do it yourself)

1. **Fonts** in `src/app/layout.tsx` via `next/font/google` or `next/font/local` (downloaded fonts are in `public/fonts/`) — families/weights from `tokens.json`
2. **`globals.css`**: map the target's palette onto the shadcn `:root` token names; add custom properties for colors that don't map; add global keyframes, scroll-snap, smooth-scroll setup found in recon
3. **TypeScript interfaces** in `src/types/` for the content structures you observed
4. **Icons**: convert the deduplicated `inlineSvgs` from `assets.json` into named components in `src/components/icons.tsx` (named by function: `LogoIcon`, `ArrowRightIcon`…)
5. **SEO**: favicons/OG from `public/seo/` wired into `layout.tsx` metadata
6. Verify `npm run build`, then build **shared chrome** (header/footer) first — full spec → lint → builder cycle like any section, since every page depends on them.

## Phase 3 — Per-Section Loop (extract → spec → lint → dispatch → merge)

Work through `manifest.mjs next` until no sections remain. For each section:

### 3a. Extract

**The default state is already extracted** — Phase 1's page.mjs run wrote
`sections/<name>.json`, `responsive.json`, and all screenshots.

**First time you enter Phase 3 for a page, probe ALL its sections in ONE call** (3
page loads total instead of 3 per section — never probe section-by-section):

```bash
node scripts/extract/probe.mjs --route <r>   # every registered section + probe-<section>.json each
# add key children in the same call when a spec will need them:
node scripts/extract/probe.mjs --route <r> --selector "<sel> h2" --selector "<sel> .card"
```

Slice the per-section tables into each spec's Responsive section as you write it.
Per section, only one thing remains:

```bash
# Per discovered behavior — one call per state (batch selectors sharing a trigger):
node scripts/extract/section.mjs <page-url> --selector "<sel>" --name <name>-hover --state hover:".card"
node scripts/extract/section.mjs <page-url> --selector "<sel>" --name <name>-scrolled --state scroll:600
# per tab/pill state: --state click:".tab-2" etc. EVERY state, not just the default.
```
State captures wait for the section's actual transition duration, so a slow fade is
recorded at its end value, not mid-flight — check `settleMs` in the output if a diff
looks wrong. The `diff` array covers `::before`/`::after` too, which is where hover
overlays usually live. Captures are **diff-only**: `diff` lists changed props (plus
`(text)`/`(classes)` changes), and `added`/`removed` carry subtrees that exist in
only one state with their styles inline — conditionally-rendered dropdowns and
panels land there. Pass `--audit` to also store the full before/after trees. Cross-check discovered behaviors against `css.json`'s
`interactiveStates` — a :hover rule in the stylesheet with no captured state means
the extraction is not done.

(No manifest command needed — page.mjs already marked the section `extracted` when it wrote the walk.)

### 3b. Write the spec — scaffold first, judgment second

```bash
node scripts/spec-scaffold.mjs --route <r> --section <name>    # or --all for the whole route
```

This generates `docs/research/components/<route-slug>/<name>.spec.md` with every
**mechanical** section already filled from the extraction JSON — frontmatter, DOM
Structure, Computed Styles, Assets, Text Content, Responsive Behavior — and any
captured states listed as reference data. **Never transcribe values from the JSON
by hand**: the scaffold is generated from the same files and can't mistype.

You fill ONLY the `<!-- AGENT: fill -->` blocks — the judgment calls:

- `interaction_model:` in the frontmatter (static | click-driven | scroll-driven | hover-driven | time-driven | mixed)
- `## States & Behaviors` — per behavior: Trigger / State A / State B / Transition + the implementation approach (CSS transition, IntersectionObserver, …). The scaffold lists each captured state's trigger/settle/diff summary as reference
- `## Per-State Content` — full content per state for tabbed/stateful sections, or "N/A — static"
- `## Notes` — builder guidance: component split, `src/data/` shape, gotchas

An unfilled scaffold fails lint-spec on purpose (invalid interaction_model), so it
can never reach a builder. Correct a generated section only when it's wrong about
the page — don't restyle it.

**Light tier:** for tiny static sections (walk ≤15 nodes, zero captured states)
the scaffold sets `tier: light` — States & Behaviors / Per-State Content may
stay a single "N/A — static" line and the minimum-length warning is waived.
Don't set it by hand: lint-spec cross-checks the walk and rejects a light tier
the section doesn't qualify for.

**Utility-CSS sites (Tailwind and friends):** page.mjs detects them and captures
each section's cleaned markup; the scaffold then contains a `## Source Markup`
section — the class list IS the spec. Builders translate the markup first and
verify with probe values second; computed styles shrink to a few key anchors.

### 3c. Lint gate
```bash
node scripts/lint-spec.mjs docs/research/components/<route-slug>/<name>.spec.md
```
Fails → extract more. Passes → dispatch (lint-spec records the `specd` stage in the manifest itself).

### 3d. Dispatch builder agent (worktree)

Every builder receives IN ITS PROMPT (never "go read the file"):
- The **full spec file contents inline**
- The screenshot paths (all 3 viewports)
- Shared imports available: `cn()`, `icons.tsx` components, shadcn `ui/` primitives, types from `src/types/`
- The target file path, and the data file to create in `src/data/` if the section has content collections
- The rule: verify `npx tsc --noEmit` passes before finishing
- On utility-CSS sites (spec has `## Source Markup`): "translate the markup's class semantics first, then verify the result against the probe values — don't rebuild from computed styles alone"
- **The ground-truth rule:** "`docs/research/<host>/sections/<name>.json` and `responsive.json` are ground truth. If this spec contradicts them, follow the JSON and report the discrepancy." Builders reliably catch spec errors this way — treat their reports as corrections to make to the spec file. Walk JSON is stored compact — builders resolve any node's full styles with `node scripts/resolve-walk.mjs <json> --node <path>` instead of parsing the styleTable by hand.

Complex section (3+ distinct sub-components) → one builder per sub-component + one for the wrapper, sub-components first. **Don't wait** — while builders run, extract the next section.

### 3e. Merge
As builders finish: merge worktree → `npm run typecheck && npm run lint` → fix errors immediately → `manifest.mjs set … --stage merged`. tsc catches the cross-worktree breaks (imports, prop types) that per-merge builds used to catch, in a fraction of the time.

**Once, after roughly half the page's sections are merged: run a full `npm run build` checkpoint.** It catches build-only failures (server/client component violations, route exports, metadata) while they're still cheap to bisect. Don't build after every merge.

## Phase 4 — Page Assembly

Per page: create `src/app/<route>/page.tsx` importing its section components with data from `src/data/`, plus page-level behaviors (scroll-snap, observers, smooth scroll). Shared chrome mounts in `layout.tsx` or a route group layout. Wire internal nav links to the cloned routes. `npm run build` must pass.

## Phase 5 — Scored QA Loop

**Serve the clone from a production build, not the dev server:**

```bash
npm run build && npm start -- -p 3000 -H 127.0.0.1   # background; localhost-only
```

Dev-mode QA pays on-demand compilation on every page load (and a stale dev-lock
cost real time in the benchmark); `next start` serves prebuilt pages, so QA
loads measure the clone, not the compiler. After each fix batch: **stop the
server, `npm run build`, start it again** — rebuilding `.next` under a running
`next start` leaves the served HTML pointing at chunk files that no longer
exist, and the clone silently renders unstyled (QA scores crater for the wrong
reason). The rebuild is incremental and fast for static pages. Fall back to
`npm run dev` only while actively iterating on a single fix where hot-reload
beats rebuild time.

Then **triage whole-page first** — never open with 27 per-section diffs:

```bash
node scripts/diff.mjs --original <orig-page-url> --clone http://localhost:3000<route> --route <r> --triage --viewport all
```

Per viewport: one whole-page diff decides everything. A **passing viewport**
(match ≥95%, every band ≥95%, heights agree) proves all its sections at once —
no per-section diffs run, sections get the worst overlapping page band as their
score. A **failing viewport** names its failing bands, and ONLY the sections
overlapping those bands get individually diffed. On a good clone the whole QA
phase is a handful of page loads.

Scores and `qa_passed` stages land in the manifest automatically — no separate
manifest commands during QA. (Plain `--route` without `--triage` still scores
every section individually if you need the full table.)

**Fix iterations stay single-section** — the original-side shots captured by the sweep are cached, so a re-diff only re-renders the clone:

```bash
node scripts/diff.mjs --original <orig-page-url> --clone http://localhost:3000<route> --selector "<sel>" --viewport all --name <name>
```

- **Pass = ≥95% on all three viewports** (diff.mjs sets `qa_passed` automatically on a `--route` sweep)
- Below 95% → **read the band breakdown, then run compare.mjs — BEFORE touching the spec or component**:
  ```bash
  node scripts/compare.mjs --original <orig-page-url> --clone http://localhost:3000<route> --selector "<sel>" --viewport <failing-vp>
  ```
  The pixel diff says THAT a band mismatches; compare.mjs says WHAT — it walks both live DOMs, aligns them structurally, and prints the differing computed properties ordered by visual impact (geometry > typography > color), plus any nodes missing/extra in the clone. Fix exactly what it names (wrong extraction → correct spec; right spec → fix component), re-diff. The diff image's `-review.png` in `docs/research/qa/` is the visual companion
- A large height mismatch reported by diff.mjs = missing content or wrong spacing — fix before pixel-tweaking
- Max 3 fix iterations per section, then record the gap honestly and move on
- **Text-heavy sections at phone width often plateau at 90–95%** when the target's font isn't available on Google Fonts (e.g. Source Sans Pro → Source Sans 3). Different metrics = different wrap points = unavoidable pixel drift. Confirm the layout matches, note the substitution, and accept it.
- **A score that's high at pc but low at ipad/phone is always a responsive-spec problem**, not a styling bug. Re-run `probe.mjs` on the section and fill in the values the spec was missing.
- Finally, test behaviors manually: scroll, click every tab, hover — screenshots can't verify motion; you must

Whole-page diffs (`--selector` omitted) at all 3 viewports close out each page.

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't build click-tabs when the original is scroll-driven** (or vice versa). Scroll first, watch, then click. Wrong model = rewrite.
- **Don't extract only the default state.** Every tab clicked, every hover captured, header at scroll 0 AND past the trigger.
- **Don't miss layered/overlay images** — check `siblingImgs` and z-index hints in `assets.json`.
- **Don't build HTML mockups of things that are actually `<video>`, Lottie, or canvas.** Check first.
- **Don't approximate ("looks like text-lg").** Use the walker's exact computed values; use arbitrary values (`text-[17px]`) when Tailwind's scale doesn't match.
- **Don't dispatch a builder without a lint-passing spec.** No exceptions — that's the whole quality model.
- **Don't reference docs from builder prompts** — spec contents go inline.
- **Don't skip the `built`/`merged` manifest updates.** Extraction, spec and QA stages self-report, but no script can see a merge — an untracked run can't resume.
- **Don't hardcode content in components.** Content → `src/data/`, components take props.
- **Don't write "same as desktop" in a Responsive section.** Root font-size steps at breakpoints on most real sites, so every number changes. Run `probe.mjs` and write the real values for all three widths — lint-spec now rejects vague responsive sections.
- **Don't forget `::before` / `::after`.** They carry hero overlays, heading underline bars, and icon glyphs. `section.mjs` captures them under a `pseudo` key — if a spec has none and the screenshot shows decorations, extraction was incomplete.
- **Don't trust the spec over the extraction JSON.** The judgment sections are hand-written and can drift; `sections/*.json` is machine-measured (and the mechanical spec sections are generated from it).
- **Don't declare done without QA scores.** "Looks right" is not a number.

## Completion Report

- Pages cloned (routes) · sections built · spec files written (must match section count)
- Assets downloaded (from `assets.json` download log, including failures)
- Final QA score table per section × viewport (from `manifest.mjs status`)
- `npm run build` result
- Known gaps and any section that couldn't reach 95%
- Suggest next step: `/restyle` to rebrand the clone with your own identity
